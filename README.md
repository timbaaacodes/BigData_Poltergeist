**Setup & run the MVP:** 
- Step 1: Use the .yaml file in the repo to create a conda environment, that will duplicate the enviroment we used to create the project.
(We assume pyspark works in your environment)
- Step 2: Include a working CLAUDE API Key in 'claude_insights.py' for the variable CLAUDE_API_KEY. This is necessary to deploy the AI empowered insights. If no key is given, only descriptive statistics will be shown
- Step 3: Run app.py. This will create local website which demonstrates the MVP functionality of the project. (On Mac the website can be visited here: http://127.0.0.1:5000)
- Step 4: Search for any search term that comes to your mind!
